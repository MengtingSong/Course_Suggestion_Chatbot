## 1. Vision and Goals Of The Project
In this project, we want to develop a chatbot mobile app to help students select courses. 
It's always a very complicated and perplexing task for students, especailly the freshman to select the right courses since the pool of open courses is quite large and changes every semester, while all the courses are interlinked as the prerequisite or the subsequent. Thus there is a strong user demand for a concise, smart, and helpful course recommendation system. Our original intention is to drive this demand.

## 2. Users/Personas Of The Project
As the first step, the application only targets at the undergraduate engineering students of Boston University(BU). 
It can be expanded to all students with different majors of the entire university, even of the other universities with completion of the course information and a smart system or platform to upload, store and manage the information of courses and student users.

## 3. Scope and Features Of The Project
The user can login with the correct BU ID. Then the user can choose from a collection of 8 semesters to view the courses  available for the specific semester. By clicking on each course, a detai page of the course will be displayed including its description, selectiveness, prerequisites and subsequent courses, etc. The user can also view the courses by interest area. The list of related courses can be found by clicking on certain interest sector.
